## Simple VJ software

There are right ways to write VJ software. I've done that. But then there is a way you can that isn't quite "right" but sure is adaptable. That's this software. 

Instead of architecting my video layers properly and creating a canvas with a WebGL context, I give you a video component and tell you to use the CSS Filter api to adjust what it looks like. 

I've found it has certain affordances that make it very playable as a musical instrument. 

I would strongly recomend you read the code. It is quite simple! Fork it and build your own rig on top.

A good place to start is the montage-organt.html file: https://github.com/lnsy-dev/montage-organ/blob/main/montage-organ.html
